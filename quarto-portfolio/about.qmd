# **Professional Summary:**

As a Masterâ€™s student in Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University, I am currently building expertise in advanced topics like time series analysis (ARIMA, GARCH, LSTM, and Transformers for time series), deep learning (ANNs, CNNs, RNNs), and database systems (SQL, NoSQL, cloud-based DBMS). This academic experience works to complement my professional background in financial analysis and data science.

In my previous role as a Senior FP&A Analyst at CharterUP Technologies, I leveraged tools like Python, Alteryx, and SQL to automate workflows, build advanced financial models, and streamline payment processing. These efforts contributed to more accurate forecasting, enhanced reporting, and better operational efficiency. I also worked at Is Inspired, LLC, where I optimized data reporting processes and developed interactive dashboards for project management and financial monitoring.
